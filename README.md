We'd like to get a feel for how you approach problems, how you think, and how you design your code.
Please complete the exercise below in Typescript and create-react-app, and upload your code to a github repo!
Thank you and have fun!

## Requirements
Your application should at least include: 
1. A simple menu with several buttons in the homepage
   
2. Clicking one of the buttons will display a login form. The form contains username input, password input, submit button and cancel button.
    
    a. Clicking submit should send the form data to a fake endpoint
        
    b. Clicking cancel should take you back to your previous menu.
        
    c. Showing error message when the username or password is incorrect

3. Unittests is required

## If you have time:
1. Imagine how this menu can be reusable. Pass a JSON data structure to render a nested menu containing buttons and clicking some buttons in the menu will either display a new nested menu.
   
## Recommendations
1. Feel free to use frameworks and libraries
    
2. Keep understandable and clear coding style

3. Include a README file with clear build instructions that we can follow.

4. Have a good git commit history
